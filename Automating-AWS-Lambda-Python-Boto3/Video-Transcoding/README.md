# Video Transcoding

CloudCraft: <https://cloudcraft.linuxacademy.com/#/labs/details/e812ec2c-1b23-4142-bcd7-ac940044e85b?courseId=313>

The CloudFormation stack creates the following resources:

- Three S3 Buckets:
  - Source bucket for uploaded video
  - Transcoded bucket for video transcoded by Elastic Transcoder
  - Thumbnails bucket for thumbnail images of video
- SNS Topic where transcoding notifications are sent

## Description

In this hands-on AWS lab, we'll learn how to convert video files to different formats using Lambda, S3, and Amazon Elastic Transcoder.

Elastic Transcoder is media service, designed to be a highly scalable, easy to use and a cost effective way to convert (or "transcode") media files from their source format into versions that will playback on devices like smartphones, tablets and PCs.

In this lab, you will upload sample videos in 4K ultra-HD format to an S3 bucket, and configure an Elastic Transcoder pipeline to automatically convert them to different formats. We'll wire all this up with our own custom Lambda function, written in Python, using the Boto3 SDK.

- Download sample 4K videos [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Aerial.mp4) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Clouds.mp4)
- Download the Lambda execution role IAM policy [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_execution_role.json)
- Download the Lambda function source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_handler.py)

## Instructions

Make sure you are in the `us-east-1` region.

S3 buckets and an SNS topic are provided for you.

1. Subscribe to the SNS topic using email
1. Create an Elastic Transcoder pipeline
1. Create a Lambda execution role
1. Create the Lambda function
1. Upload a video for transcoding

## Video Description(s)

### Part 1 - Create Elastic Transcoder Pipeline

Pipelines are queues that manage your transcoding jobs. While creating jobs you can specify the settings regarding the location of the input/output file. Presets are templates that specify most of the settings for the transcoded media file.

### Part 2 - Create Lambda Execution Role

Create the Lambda execution role using the IAM policy [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_execution_role.json)

### Part 3 - Create Lambda Function

Create the Lambda function using the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_handler.py)

### Part 4 - Upload Video for Transcoding

Download sample 4K videos [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Aerial.mp4) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Clouds.mp4)

Upload one of the videos to the S3 "source" bucket. Observe that the transcoded videos appear in the "transcoded" bucket.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Subscribe to SNS Topic

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to SNS.
- Select the "Transcode" topic.
- Under "Actions", select "Subscribe to topic"
- In the Protocol drop-down box, select Email.
- In the Endpoint box, type an email address you can use to receive the notification.
- Choose Create subscription.
- Go to your email application and open the message from AWS Notifications, and then choose the link to confirm your subscription.

### Task 2 - Create Elastic Transcoder Pipeline

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Elastic Transcoder
- Under Pipelines, select "Create New Pipeline"
- Pipeline Name: Enter any name you like
- Input bucket: Select the existing bucket with `source` in the name
- Allow the IAM role to be created automatically
- For transcoded files, select the existing bucket with `transcoded` in the name
- Storage Class: Choose either Standard or Reduced Redundancy
- For thumbnails, select the existing bucket with `thumbnails` in the name
- Storage Class: Choose either Standard or Reduced Redundancy
- Note the Pipeline ID. This is available under pipeline details, and is a *different* value than the pipeline name.

### Task 3 - Create Lambda Function

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to AWS Lambda
- Select Create Function
- Give the function any name you like
- For runtime, choose `Python 3.7`
- Create a custom role, using the IAM policy [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_execution_role.json)
- Select create function
- Select S3 as the trigger, and choose the bucket with `source` in the name
- Select "All object create events"
- Click "Add"
- Click the function name at the top of the page to enable the function editor
- Paste in the function body using the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/lambda_handler.py)
- Set an environment variable called `PIPELINE_ID` and set its value to the pipeline ID from the previous task.
- Save the Lambda function

### Task 4 - Upload Video for Transcoding

- Download the sample 4K videos [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Aerial.mp4) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-lambda-boto3/master/Video-Transcoding/Clouds.mp4)
- Navigate to the S3 bucket with `source` in its name.
- Upload one of the 4K video files.
- Observe in CloudWatch Logs and in your email inbox that the transcoding job completed successfully.
- Navigate to the S3 bucket with `transcoded` in its name.
- Verify that 1080p and 720p versions of your uploaded video are present.
